# Hi! I'm Rodrigo :wave:

Over the past years I’ve contributed to open source, and helped different communities to grow. I love to keep learning, and my last interesting subject I’m getting involved is Cybersecurity. If you would like to see some of my events, click [here](https://githubcampus.expert/roeeyn/).

I’ve been working primarily on Python and JavaScript, both with different libraries and frameworks.

I decided to write posts that shows useful, but hard to find knowledge. Also, I try to make beginner friendly content that makes easier to jump in the developer path.
